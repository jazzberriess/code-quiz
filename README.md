# Code Quiz

## Description

A short code quiz designed to test our knowledge of JavaScript and Web API's.

This project was mainly focused on further building skills in JavaScript and expanding our skillset into learning about Web API's. We learned how to make dynamic designs that are interactive for a more engaging user experience.

I found this project to be quite a challenge as JavaScript is taking me a little longer to grasp compared to HTML and CSS. I think the most challenging part is learning how to think computationally to solve problems as the come up. 

I do, however, feel that I've improved (at least a little!) upon my JavaScript abilities compared to the last project.
